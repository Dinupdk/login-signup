🚀 Login and Signup Form using Python, Tkinter, and MySQL! 🔐

I recently developed a Login and Signup system using Tkinter for the GUI and MySQL for secure data storage.

🔑 Key Features:

User-friendly login and signup interfaces
Data validation and error handling for seamless user experience
Integration with MySQL to securely store and manage user credentials
This project showcases my ability to build intuitive front-end applications while maintaining secure back-end functionality using databases.

Looking forward to applying these skills to future projects! 💡
